<h1>Whale Talk</h1>
<p>Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.<p>

<ul>There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

<li>There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.</li>
<li>The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.</li>
<li>Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.</li>

</ul>

<p>To accomplish this translation, we can use our knowledge of loops. Let’s get started!</p>
